# D.C. Landlords and Evictions - What's out there #

Using data available through OpenDataDC, we will examine how property ownership in the district has shifted since the financial crisis that began in 2008. More specifically, we will tease out and compare the numbers of residential units owned and rented by landlords to look for shifts over time — has the rental market predominantly shifted into the hands of corporations and wealthier owners, or are there still just as many "mom and pop" landlords that rent out a place or two on Craigslist?

Further, we will compare any shift we find with eviction data from the district to shed light on what this all may mean with the impending end to the eviction moratorium.

## Reporting we found ##

**Evictions in the District**

+ [Washington City Paper](https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/500983/these-landlords-file-the-most-evictions-in-d-c/) reported in October 2020 that 10 landlords who own 16% of rental properties in the District filed 37% of evictions between 2014 and 2019. This article presents who many think will be main players in the coming eviction crisis, but does not give a full look at the eviction landscape. 
+ [DCist](https://dcist.com/story/20/12/16/judge-strikes-down-dc-ban-eviction-filings/) reported in December that a D.C. Superior Court Judge ruled that a ban on eviction filings during the pandemic was unconstitutional. Although evictions still cannot legally take place, landlords may continue to file complaints in court, and hearings can begin as soon as the moratorium ends.
+ [Street Sense Media](https://www.streetsensemedia.org/article/seal-tenant-eviction-records-limit-landlord-filing/#.YBNh0ehKhPY) reported in October that D.C. City Council passed a bill to change some of the rules regarding evictions to the benefit of renters. The new law restricts landlords from discriminating against renters with a prior eviction on record and mandates the sealing of eviction records after 30 days if the eviction is not carried out and three years if it is.

**Housing in the times of COVID**

+ According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifercastenson/2020/10/12/the-pandemic-threatens-the-already-vulnerable-affordable-housing-crisis/?sh=e345bcc393d3), affordable housing development projects rely greatly on government support, and the pandemic has cost cities around the country millions in revenue. Meanwhile, mom-and-pop landlords have been left out to dry.
+ In October, [WAMU](https://wamu.org/story/20/10/27/dc-landlords-eviction-moratorium-coronavirus-pandemic-relief-housing/) reported on these landlords struggling during the pandemic in Washington DC. The moratorium on evictions has left mom-and-pop landlords without much recourse and many are left with the tough choice of losing money while still needing to make mortgage payments or selling out to larger corporate property owners. According to WAMU, DC’s policy is more focused on the large landlords. In September, landlord attorneys argued before a D.C. Superior Court judge that owners should be able to initiate evictions against tenants who have had longstanding problems unrelated to the pandemic
+ In December, the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/12/09/small-landlords-struggle-under-covid-eviction-moratoriums/) reported on the subject after Mayor Bowser announced a new program offering $10 million in funding for landlords to help pay off back rent. Landlord advocates say it was a welcome step forward, but fear it may be too late for some. 

**What's with all these fancy apartments around D.C.?**

+ [Wtop News](https://wtop.com/business-finance/2016/08/down-side-of-dcs-luxury-apartment-boom/) reported back in 2016 that the majority of rentals being built in DC are luxury apartment buildings. These buildings have been sprouting in neighborhoods that weren't upper end residential areas before, causing both an increase in rental prices for luxury apartments and even for affordable housing in DC.
+ Right at the start of the pandemic, [Rebusiness Online](https://rebusinessonline.com/washingtons-tech-boom-changes-the-multifamily-investment-calculus/) wrote this article explaining how more tech jobs means more tech money and a demand for the above-mentioned luxury apartment buildings. More demand will allow investors to increase rental prices.
+ Thought not specifically targeting apartments, [Washington Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2019/09/04/as-d-c-area-housing-market-booms-researchers-warn.html) ran this story in September of 2019 highlighting a study estimating that over 200,000 D.C. residents could be displaced in the following years because of higher housing costs.

## Reporting we didn't find (and what we want to answer) ##

We want to look more broadly at the landscape of landlords in DC in terms of big vs. little and compare that to eviction data or expectations. We have a dataset of all the Basic Business Licenses DC has issued since 2008, which tells us the number of landlords in the city and how many own which type of rental (single-family, two-family, apartment or co-op). We'll be able to use that data to figure out how the rental landscape has changed since the financial crisis, and we'll be able to use data and reporting from Princeton's Eviction Lab as well as other places to show how the size of landlord affects a tenants chance of eviction.
