# Assignment 3
* Is there a relation between reliable news and accessability? Are less reliable and more bias news more easily accessable? 
* Does a viewer's education or media literacy have a role to play in the news they consume?
* Collecting Data:
   * I reviewed the reliability and bias of a news outlet from Ad Fontes media Bias Chart.
   * I searched over Google for rough estimations of audience size of each news outlet. Not all sites' data was available.
   * Audience Education would be difficult to find. Some outlets poll their readers and have some data available.
   * I searched each site to see if a paywall would come up that prevented me from reading articles.
      * Some of these sites may allow a limited number of free articles, so it may be skewed.
   * Link to my data [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qCg9LeU7prBE6Z0KEf592snA2uG8TKxRPGGmbQdZJ8E/edit?usp=sharing).
