# Assignment 1
1. Clarity and Accuracy
   * Central Insight: 4
      * The headline seems clear enough, though I had to reread through it a few times to grasp what the data found. The confusing part is how the author writes that both AirBnB's claim and critics are both correct. Most of AirBnB local listings are for short-term/vacation services but at least 350 listings are considered full-time rentals, taking away from the city's housing.
   * Data Visualization: 4
      * There are three charts, a map chart showing the concentration of listings by district in the city and two column charts that show the increase in the types of property listings and average prices.
   * Accuracy: 5
      * The data was commissioned through two data extraction companies that got the data from AirBnB and other rental listing agencies. 
2. Quality: 5
    * The map chart is great, it is large and provides details for each district.
3. Type & Color
    * Type: 5
       * I think the charts do a good enough job in presenting the data in a clear and concise way.
    * Color: 4
       * Color scheme for the map chart works well enough to see. The two charts that focus on the difference in prices and property types over two years could have had better colors to match.
4. Creativity: 4
    * Both charts present the data well enough for the reader to understand. I like how the map chart gives further breakdown details when the pointer hovers over it. Other than that, nothing else really stood out.
